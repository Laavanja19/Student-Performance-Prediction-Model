Student Performance Prediction Model Using different types of SVM Kernels


# Dataset Preprocessing
## Dataset : Student Performance (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neurocipher/student-performance)

## Source : Kaggle

## Dataset split 
* Training Images: 8000
* Testing Images: 2000

The dataset originally contained a continuous target variable. To enable supervised multi-class classification, the continuous values were transformed into discrete values with the following labels: Excellent, Good,Average and Poor.

## Description
It is experimented with different types of SVM Kernels, including **Linear**, **Polynomial** and **RBF** - to evalaute and compare their performance in classifying the dataset
